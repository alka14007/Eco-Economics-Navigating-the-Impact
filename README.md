# About the Dataset

The timeline being compared in this study is between the Years 2008 to the Year 2022. This data has been collected from The World Bank Databases on the topic of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Data-data#). The dataset represented all 193 recognized countries in total but this study is mainly focused on five countries for research:

United States: It is the third-largest country in the world by land mass area with around 9.8 million square kilometers.

India: It is the seventh-largest country in the world by land mass area with about 3.29 million square kilometers.

Indonesia: It is the largest archipelagic country and the fourth most populous country in the world. However, its total land area is approximately 1.9 million square kilometers.

Australia: It is pertinent to study the environmental impact on the economy due to its significant dependence on natural resources, especially in mining and agriculture. The country faces challenges in managing economic growth while addressing environmental concerns related to land use, biodiversity, and climate change.

Netherlands: This country provides valuable insights into managing the environmental impact on the economy through sustainable practices. As a highly developed nation and with a focus on innovation & environmental policies, the Netherlands demonstrates how advanced economies can balance economic prosperity with responsible resource management and conservation efforts.

# Who can benefit from this research?

- This analysis is beneficial for investors of upcoming industries and builders of new factories, stakeholders, and consumers who will be using the resources. Such data can also help people acknowledge their usage of natural resources and take proper precautions to reduce the overuse of these resources which leads to the degradation of nature and the environment.

- Analyzing and reading such data is also helpful for governments to take informed actions in favor of the environment and limit the usage of chemicals and toxic behaviors of these chemicals.

# Conclusion

So what is the gist of this article?
This article presents a concise overview of the effects of social governance and natural resource utilization on the environment and economies It is necessary that the global population understands the current climate change crisis and the variables influencing it. Everyone can play a part in creating a greener and cleaner future by getting involved at the local level. Reusing clothing, refurbishing old furniture, protecting the environment, and not throwing things out in the open are all very simple and small steps to consider. For many of us, sorting our recyclables could be the very first step to a better future for coming generations. As demonstrated, governance and the right policies can also help in preventing this crisis which in turn can boost the economy using sustainable and renewable resources.

In Visualization, how interpretation risks can be mitigated?
It is imperative to mitigate interpretation risks in visualization to ensure that the audience understands the data and the message that is being conveyed through the visual aid. To try different graphs and plots is one way to learn which plots suit and describe the data best. Some of the other ways to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding in visual aids could be:

- Clearly Define Metrics and Variables: Make sure to clearly label legends, axes, and other visualization elements.
- Provide Context and Explanation: Give users background information and an explanation of the visualization's purpose by including contextual information.
- Prevent Misleading Scaling: Make sure the scale in the graphic is appropriate. To manipulate perception, refrain from omitting important values or using inflated scales. The ranked bar plot shown in "Chapter 1" above is a great example because using mean over median is often misleading in large datasets.
